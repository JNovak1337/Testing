# Testing
A few of my first simple tests ever.
List of test below ↓

1) Different Browser Test → → Internet Explorer not working yet (not able to fill e-mail).

2) Facebook Registration Test → → You are not going to register, it only fills out name/email and pick dates etc.

3) HTML Test Report → → Basic test that opens Facebook and then report it back with HTML files you can open.

4) NOT_FINISHED → →  I was trying to set-up PageObjects, it is not working yet.

5) Parallel Browsers → → 10 Chrome Browsers opening Facebook page and filling email (can be changed in AssemblyInfo.cs)

6) Screenshot Output Test → → Version of Parallel Browsers but only with One browser that fills e-mail and takes a screenshot.
